# Valence: A Vision for the Epistemic Commons

*Reclaiming knowledge sovereignty in the age of AI*

## The Problem We Face

We are living through an epistemic crisis. The systems that mediate our relationship with knowledge—social media, search engines, news aggregators—have optimized for engagement over truth, virality over accuracy, and extraction over empowerment. The result:

- **Information asymmetry**: Platforms know everything about us; we know almost nothing about them or the information they curate for us
- **Epistemic fragmentation**: Filter bubbles and algorithmic curation create incompatible realities
- **Knowledge extraction**: Our insights, preferences, and beliefs are harvested to train AI systems we don't control and that don't serve us
- **Trust collapse**: We can no longer agree on basic facts because the systems that deliver information have no incentive to be truthful

Meanwhile, AI is accelerating. Large language models can synthesize, generate, and manipulate information at unprecedented scale. Without intervention, these tools will amplify existing problems—making misinformation more convincing, extraction more thorough, and manipulation more precise.

**The question is not whether AI will transform our relationship with knowledge. The question is: who will control that transformation?**

## The Valence Vision

Valence is infrastructure for a different future—one where:

### Knowledge Belongs to People, Not Platforms

Every person has a **sovereign knowledge substrate**: a personal database of beliefs, decisions, insights, and learned patterns that belongs entirely to them. Not stored on corporate servers. Not mined for advertising. Not used to train models without consent.

Your knowledge substrate is:
- **Yours**: Stored on infrastructure you control
- **Portable**: Never locked into any platform or provider
- **Private by default**: Nothing leaves without explicit consent
- **AI-native**: Designed from the ground up to work with AI agents

### AI Agents That Represent You

Your AI isn't a product sold to you. It's an agent that represents you. Its loyalty is to you, not to any platform, advertiser, or third party.

This agent:
- **Remembers** what matters to you across conversations and contexts
- **Learns** your preferences, values, and decision patterns
- **Grounds** its responses in your accumulated knowledge, not just its training data
- **Protects** your information, sharing only what you explicitly authorize

When you interact with an AI through Valence, you're not a user being served. You're a principal being represented.

### Collective Intelligence Without Surveillance

Here's where it gets interesting.

Individual knowledge substrates are valuable. But knowledge becomes more powerful when it can be shared, corroborated, and built upon collectively. The challenge: how do you get the benefits of collective intelligence without the surveillance and extraction that usually comes with it?

Valence Federation solves this through **privacy-preserving aggregation**:

- **Differential privacy**: When you contribute to collective knowledge, mathematical guarantees ensure your individual beliefs cannot be extracted from the aggregate
- **Trust networks**: You choose who to share with and at what level of detail
- **Earned trust**: Nodes build reputation through the accuracy and consistency of their contributions, not through credentials or payment
- **Productive tensions**: When beliefs conflict across the network, the system surfaces the disagreement rather than forcing resolution—multiple perspectives coexist with different confidence levels

The result: collective intelligence that emerges from individual contributions while preserving individual privacy and autonomy.

## How It Works

### The Personal Layer

At its core, Valence is a **belief store**. Not documents. Not posts. *Beliefs*—atomic claims about the world with:

- **Content**: What you believe ("PostgreSQL handles concurrent writes better than MySQL for this workload")
- **Confidence**: How certain you are, across multiple dimensions (source reliability, method quality, temporal freshness)
- **Provenance**: Where this belief came from and how it was derived
- **Temporality**: When it was true, when it stopped being true, what superseded it

Your AI agent uses this substrate to:
- Answer questions grounded in what you actually know and have decided
- Make recommendations consistent with your values and past choices
- Identify gaps in your knowledge
- Notice when new information contradicts old beliefs

### The Federation Layer

Individual nodes can form **trust networks**—federations of knowledge substrates that share and corroborate information while preserving sovereignty.

**Privacy-Preserving Queries**: "What does the federation believe about X?" can be answered without revealing what any individual believes. Differential privacy adds calibrated noise; secure aggregation prevents any single node from seeing individual contributions.

**Trust Through Behavior**: Nodes don't earn trust through credentials, payment, or social proof. They earn it through:
- Accuracy of shared beliefs (did they turn out to be true?)
- Quality of extractions (when they cite sources, are the citations accurate?)
- Consistency of contribution (do they participate reliably?)

**Graduated Access**: New nodes start as observers, progress to contributors, then participants, then anchors. Trust is earned over time through demonstrated behavior.

**Graceful Degradation**: Bad actors aren't banned—they're attenuated. Their influence decreases proportionally to their untrustworthiness. The system doesn't need to make binary "in or out" decisions.

### The Aggregation Layer

The magic happens when individual knowledge combines into collective intelligence:

**Corroboration**: When multiple independent nodes hold similar beliefs, confidence increases. When your belief is corroborated by nodes you trust, that information flows back to you.

**Contradiction Detection**: When beliefs conflict across the federation, the system surfaces the tension. This isn't a bug—it's a feature. Disagreement is information.

**Collective Confidence**: Aggregated queries return not just what "everyone" believes, but how much agreement exists, how many sources contributed, and what the confidence distribution looks like.

## The Societal Impact

### Restoring Epistemic Agency

Today, algorithms decide what information reaches you. You have no insight into why, no ability to audit, no meaningful control.

Valence inverts this. Your agent curates information based on your beliefs, your values, your explicitly stated preferences. The algorithm is yours. You can inspect it, modify it, replace it.

This isn't just about privacy. It's about **epistemic agency**—the ability to be an active participant in your own knowledge formation rather than a passive recipient of curated content.

### Building Trust Infrastructure

The current internet has no trust layer. We bolt on verification, fact-checking, and moderation as afterthoughts. They don't scale and they're trivially gamed.

Valence proposes trust as infrastructure:
- Trust computed from behavior, not declared credentials
- Trust that's domain-specific (someone can be trusted on technical topics but not political ones)
- Trust that decays without reinforcement
- Trust that's local to each user (you decide who you trust, not a central authority)

This creates the foundation for a healthier information ecosystem.

### Enabling True Collective Intelligence

Today's "collective intelligence" is extracted intelligence. Wikipedia works because volunteers donate labor. Social media works because users donate attention and data. AI works because creators donate training material (often without consent).

Valence enables collective intelligence where:
- **Contribution is voluntary and controlled**
- **Privacy is mathematically guaranteed**
- **Value flows back to contributors** (through corroboration, through access to collective knowledge)
- **No central party extracts surplus**

This is collective intelligence that serves the collective.

### Preparing for AI Alignment at Scale

As AI systems become more capable, the question of alignment becomes existential. Aligned with whom? By whose values?

Valence suggests an answer: **distributed alignment**. Instead of training AI on scraped internet data and hoping it reflects human values, train it on the accumulated knowledge of humans who have explicitly agreed to contribute and who maintain ongoing agency over their contributions.

This doesn't solve alignment. But it creates infrastructure where alignment can be negotiated rather than imposed.

## Principles That Constrain

Valence isn't just a product. It's a set of principles that constrain what the system can become:

1. **User Sovereignty**: Users own their data. No exceptions, no asterisks.

2. **Structurally Incapable of Betrayal**: Architecture, not promises. The system can't be turned against users because the design makes it impossible.

3. **Aggregation Serves Users**: The sole valid purpose. If aggregation doesn't benefit users, it doesn't happen.

4. **Designed to Survive Being Stolen**: Open patterns that work even if copied. We optimize for the pattern existing in the world, not for capture.

5. **AI-Centric**: Built for what's coming, not retrofitted.

These principles are constitutional. They constrain evolution. Changes that violate principles aren't evolution—they're corruption.

## What Success Looks Like

**For individuals**: You have an AI assistant that actually knows you—your beliefs, your decisions, your values. It represents you rather than surveilling you. Your knowledge compounds over time rather than being scattered across platforms you don't control.

**For communities**: Groups can form knowledge networks where expertise compounds, disagreements are productive, and collective knowledge emerges without requiring trust in any central authority.

**For society**: The infrastructure exists for healthier epistemics—for trust that's earned rather than declared, for disagreement that clarifies rather than divides, for AI that serves people rather than extracting from them.

**For the future**: When AGI arrives, it will interact with humans who have maintained agency over their knowledge and values, rather than humans who have outsourced their epistemics to systems they don't understand or control.

## The Path Forward

Valence is being built in layers:

1. **Personal substrate**: Store beliefs, track conversations, learn patterns (implemented)
2. **Federation protocol**: Connect substrates into trust networks (implemented)
3. **Privacy-preserving aggregation**: Enable collective intelligence (in progress)
4. **Trust infrastructure**: Earned reputation, graceful degradation (in progress)
5. **Ecosystem**: Applications built on sovereign knowledge (future)

The code is open. The principles are published. The patterns are designed to propagate.

This isn't about building a company or capturing a market. It's about establishing infrastructure for a future where knowledge remains in the hands of the people who create it.

## Join Us

Valence is early. The ideas are clear but the implementation is incomplete. We need:

- **Contributors**: Engineers, researchers, designers who believe in this vision
- **Users**: People willing to run nodes and provide feedback
- **Thinkers**: Critics who will find the holes in our reasoning
- **Resources**: Funding that doesn't compromise principles

If the current trajectory of AI and information systems concerns you, and if you believe that better infrastructure could lead to better outcomes, we should talk.

The epistemic commons is being enclosed. Valence is an attempt to keep it open.
