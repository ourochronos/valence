## 9:36 PM — Parity PRs + Inference Working End-to-End

### PRs Merged (#545–#549)
- **#545** (closes #544): Remove legacy v1 routes — beliefs/entities/tensions REST, entity MCP handlers, dead formatters. Moved `/beliefs/conflicts` → `/contentions/detect`. **-1,629 lines**
- **#546** (closes #543): REST parity — `GET /search`, `POST /articles/compile`, `DELETE /admin/forget/{type}/{id}`. All delegate to existing MCP handlers. +12 tests.
- **#547** (closes #542): MCP tool parity — added 5 missing Tool() definitions (source_list, article_search, provenance_get, provenance_link, contention_detect). 34 tools = 34 handlers, perfect 1:1.
- **#548** (closes #541): OpenAPI spec rewrite — 11 stale paths → 44 v2 endpoints. Version bumped to 2.0.0. Note: `docs/**` is in CI paths-ignore, needed trivial code change to trigger checks.
- **#549**: Fix Decimal serialization in `db.serialize_row()` + circular reference in `_all_articles`. Both only manifested when compilation actually succeeded via inference.

### Inference Working End-to-End
- **Callback pipeline confirmed**: Valence server → callback backend → OpenClaw gateway (port 18789) → Anthropic → structured JSON response
- **Compilation works**: Compiled 2 articles from 2 sources, produced proper PageIndex article with title, content, provenance
- **Tree building works**: Built 4-node tree with character offsets for source via same pipeline
- Config stored in `system_config` table: `{"provider": "callback", "callback_url": "http://127.0.0.1:18789/valence/inference"}`
- Server loads inference config from DB at startup (app.py lifespan)

### Branch Cleanup Complete
- Deleted 30 stale branches, only `main` remains
- 14 stale `/tmp/valence-*` worktree dirs removed
- Session ingestion content preserved at `/tmp/preserved-branch-content/`

### Parity Achieved
- **REST**: 44 endpoints documented in OpenAPI
- **MCP**: 34 tools, 34 handlers, 1:1
- **CLI**: 17 top-level commands

### Bugs Found & Fixed
- `db.serialize_row()` missing Decimal → float conversion
- `compilation.py`: `_all_articles` circular reference (list contained parent dict which contained list)
- CLI token was stale after server restart — created new token, stored in `~/.valence/cli.toml`
- `contention_detect` MCP handler was legit (wraps `core.contention.detect_contention`), just missing Tool() definition
- Entity MCP handlers were truly dead (reference `entities` table that doesn't exist in v2)

### Current State
- **main HEAD**: `25a455c`
- **Server**: PID 24772, commit 25a455c
- **Tests**: 1,635 passed, 10 skipped
- **CLI token**: `vt_c70030d...` in `~/.valence/cli.toml`
- **New articles from test compile**: `1bd83ddb` (PageIndex architecture), `dc946d29` (Valence tooling reference)

### Next Steps
1. Build trees for all ~73 untree'd sources (inference now works)
2. Recompile all 85 existing articles (were compiled in degraded/concatenation mode)
3. Test retrieval quality with real queries
4. Audit + cleanup pass before release
